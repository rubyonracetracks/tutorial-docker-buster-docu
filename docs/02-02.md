In this chapter, you will use [Hugo Neutrino](https://github.com/rubyonracetracks/hugo_neutrino) to create a new Hugo app.  As was the case with the previous chapter, you will use a Docker environment.  Unlike the case with the previous chapter, you will execute this process as a regular user instead of as root.

## Downloading the Hugo Neutrino Code
* In a shell terminal, enter the following commands:
```
cd
mkdir -p docker-hugo
cd docker-hugo
git clone https://github.com/rubyonracetracks/hugo_neutrino.git
```
* Enter the command `cd hugo_neutrino`.

## Creating the Hugo App
* Enter the command `bash main.sh`.
* When prompted for an app name, just press "Enter" to use the default app name.
* Hugo Neutrino will take a few moments to download a special Docker image customized for Hugo Neutrino.  Note that this Docker image comes with Hugo pre-installed AND comes with a regular user.  This makes it possible to run the Hugo app creation scripts as a regular user instead of as root.
* Once the Docker image has been downloaded and the associated Docker container has been created, the process of creating the new app will take a second or two at most.
* Once the new Hugo app is ready, use the "cd" command to enter its root directory.  Then run the command `bash build.sh; bash server.sh` to build the Hugo app and run the local server.
* Open your web browser, and go to the URL http://localhost:1313/ on your host system.  Your new app should appear.
* In the Docker container, press Ctrl-C to stop the Hugo server when you're ready to move on.

## Deleting the App
Open the file manager app in the host OS, and delete your app from there.  Because the app was created as a regular user instead of as root, you do NOT need to be root to delete it.

## Cleaning Up Docker
* In your Docker container, enter the command `exit` to return to the host system.
* To delete all Docker networks, enter the command `docker network prune -f`.
* To view the list of Docker containers, enter the command `docker ps -a`.
* To delete all of these Docker containers, enter the following commands:
```
for i in $(docker ps -a -q)
do
  docker kill $i; wait;
  docker rm -f $i; wait;
done;
```
* To view the list of Docker containers, enter the command `docker ps -a`.  This list should now be empty.
* To view the list of Docker images, enter the command `docker images -a`.
* To delete all of these Docker images, enter the following commands:
```
for i in $(docker images -a -q)
do
  docker kill $i; wait;
  docker rmi -f $i; wait;
done;
```
* To view the list of Docker images, enter the command `docker images -a`.  This list should now be empty.
