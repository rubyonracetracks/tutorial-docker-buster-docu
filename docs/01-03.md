In this chapter, you will try out the Hello World and BusyBox images.

## Topics Covered
* Basic Docker commands

## List of Docker Containers
Enter the command `docker ps -a` to show all of the Docker containers currently in your system.  Of course, there will be none, and the screen output will be the following:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```
## List of Docker Images
Enter the command `docker images -a` to show all of the Docker images currently in your system.  Again, there will be none, and the screen output will be the following:
```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
```

## Hello World Image
* Enter the command `docker run hello-world`.
* The screen output should be something like this:
```
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
0e03bdcc26d7: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:8e3114318a995a1ee497790535e7b88365222a21771ae7e53687ad76563e8e76
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (amd64)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:

```
* Because you didn't already have the hello-world Docker image on your machine, Docker downloaded it and created a new Docker container from it.  This Docker image is configured to automatically print out that "Hello from Docker" message.
* Enter the command `docker ps -a` to list the Docker containers.  You should see something like this:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
df0d2321ef9d        hello-world         "/hello"            26 seconds ago      Exited (0) 25 seconds ago                       gallant_chatelet
```
* As you can see, you now have one Docker container based on the hello-world Docker image.  The last command used in this Docker container is "/hello".
* Enter the command `docker images -a` to list the Docker images.  You should see something like this:
```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello-world         latest              bf756fb1ae65        3 months ago        13.3kB
```
* As you can see, you have the hello-world Docker image.  It's extremely small (only 13.3 kB), so there's not much to it.

## BusyBox Image
* Enter the command `docker run busybox`.  This downloads the busybox Docker image and starts up a container based on it.  The screen output should look something like this:
```
Unable to find image 'busybox:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/busybox
e2334dd9fee4: Pull complete 
Digest: sha256:a8cf7ff6367c2afa2a90acd081b484cbded349a7076e7bdf37a05279f276bc12
Status: Downloaded newer image for busybox:latest
```
* Enter the command `docker ps -a` to list the Docker containers.  You should see something like this:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES
f1fb5ba9ce9c        busybox             "sh"                34 seconds ago       Exited (0) 33 seconds ago                           zen_galileo
df0d2321ef9d        hello-world         "/hello"            About a minute ago   Exited (0) About a minute ago                       gallant_chatelet
```
* As you can see, you now have a second Docker container.  The newer one is based on the busybox Docker image.  The last command used in this Docker container is "sh".
* Enter the command `docker images -a` to list the Docker images.  You should see something like this:
```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
busybox             latest              be5888e67be6        6 days ago          1.22MB
hello-world         latest              bf756fb1ae65        3 months ago        13.3kB
```
* As you can see, you now have the busybox Docker image as well.
* Enter the command `docker run -it busybox sh`.
* Now your terminal has the prompt "/ #", which signifies that any commands you type are executed within the Docker container instead of within your host system.
* Enter the command `pwd`.  You'll see that you're in the very top directory, "/".
* Enter the command `whoami`.  You'll see that you are the root user.
* Enter the command `ls -l`.  The screen output should be something like this:
```

```
* Enter the command `mkdir blahblahblah`.
* Enter the command `ls -l`.  Note that the new "blahblahblah" directory now appears.  The screen output should be something like this:
```

drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root          4096 Apr 14 01:10 var
```
* Enter the command "exit" to return to your host OS.
* Enter the command `docker ps -a` to list the Docker containers.  Note that there is now a second Docker container based on the busybox image.  You should see something like this:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED              STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES

```
* Enter the command `docker run -it busybox ls -l`.  This executes the `ls -l` command within the Docker container from the host OS.  Note that the prompt in your terminal is still that of the host OS and not that of the Docker container.  Note that the blahblahblah directory is gone, because this is NOT the same Docker container as the one in which you created the blahblahblah directory.  The screen output should be something like this:
```

```
* Enter the command `docker ps -a`.  The screen output should be something like this:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                          PORTS               NAMES

```
* Note that there is now a third Docker container based on the busybox image.  Note that the last command you executed in it from the host OS is `ls -l`.
* Enter the command `docker run -it busybox pwd`.  This executes the `pwd` command within the Docker container from the host OS.  The screen output should simply be `/`.
* Enter the command `docker ps -a`.  The screen output should be something like this:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES

```

## Deleting Docker Containers
* Enter the command `docker ps -a`.  The screen output should be something like this:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
042cb9d55027        busybox             "pwd"               37 seconds ago      Exited (0) 36 seconds ago                       dreamy_ellis
9560833ec38f        busybox             "ls -l"             3 minutes ago       Exited (0) 3 minutes ago                        gifted_wozniak
c9e9b5a1b996        busybox             "sh"                5 minutes ago       Exited (0) 4 minutes ago                        naughty_bartik
f1fb5ba9ce9c        busybox             "sh"                7 minutes ago       Exited (0) 7 minutes ago                        zen_galileo
df0d2321ef9d        hello-world         "/hello"            9 minutes ago       Exited (0) 9 minutes ago                        gallant_chatelet
```
* Note that each Docker container has a container ID number, which is listed in the CONTAINER_ID column.
* For each Docker container, enter the command "docker rm (container ID)".  In this example, you'd enter the following commands:
```
docker rm 042cb9d55027
docker rm 9560833ec38f
docker rm c9e9b5a1b996    
docker rm f1fb5ba9ce9c
docker rm df0d2321ef9d
```
* Enter the command `docker ps -a`.  You should see that there are no Docker containers.  The screen output should be:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
```
* Enter the command `docker images -a`.  You'll see that both Docker images are still in place.  The screen output should be something like this:
```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
busybox             latest              be5888e67be6        6 days ago          1.22MB
hello-world         latest              bf756fb1ae65        3 months ago        13.3kB
```
* Enter the command `docker run busybox`.  There should be no screen output this time, because the busybox Docker image is still stored locally.  Thus, there is no need to download it.
* Enter the command `docker ps -a`.  The screen output should be something like:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
b34f65cff723        busybox             "sh"                9 seconds ago       Exited (0) 8 seconds ago                       charming_euclid
```
* Remove the Docker container.  For the above example, the command is `docker rm b34f65cff723`.
* Enter the command `docker ps -a`.  The list of Docker containers should be empty.

## Deleting Docker images.
* Enter the command `docker images -a`.  The output should still be something like:
```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
busybox             latest              be5888e67be6        6 days ago          1.22MB
hello-world         latest              bf756fb1ae65        3 months ago        13.3kB
```
* For each Docker image, enter the command "docker rmi (image ID)".  In this example, you'd enter the following commands:
```
docker rmi be5888e67be6
docker rmi bf756fb1ae65
```
* Enter the command `docker images -a`.  The list of Docker images should be empty, and the screen output should be:
```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
```
