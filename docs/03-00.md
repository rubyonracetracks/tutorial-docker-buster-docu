In Unit 3, you will use the rbenv-rails-general Docker image.  It's based on the Minimal Rbenv image, which is based on the Minimal Stage 2 image and contains rbenv for managing Ruby versions.  The rbenv-rails-general image includes specific versions of Ruby and specific versions of Rails and other gems.

You will learn how to set up a basic Ruby on Rails development environment, view your app in the browser, and view its database.
