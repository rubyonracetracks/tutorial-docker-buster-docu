In this chapter, you will run the app you created in the previous chapter.  In the previous chapter, you used the "docker run" command to start Docker.  When you created the Docusaurus app with the "docusaurus-init" command, it automatically provided a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file in the new app.  In this chapter, you will make use of the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml file to set up Docker and run the app.

## Topics Covered
* Docker-Compose

## Ownership By Root
Please note that the Docusaurus app you created is owned by root in not only the Docker environment but in your host environment as well.  While it's easy to change ownership of files from root to that of your regular username, I disagree with this practice and will show you my way of doing things in later chapters.

## Starting the Docker Container
* In a shell terminal, enter the following commands:
```
cd
mkdir -p docker-docu
cd docker-docu
cd docusaurus-tutorial
docker-compose build
```
* It will take a few minutes to set up the Docker container and build the tutorial app.  When the process is finished, the screen output should look something like this:
```

* When the build process is finished, note that the shell prompt is in the host environment instead of Docker.
* Enter the command `docker ps -a`.  The list of Docker containers should be blank.  Note that the build process removed the Docker containers once they were no longer needed to execute commands.
* Enter the command `docker images -a`.  The screen output should look something like this:

* The Docker image with the name "node" is the original one specified as the base image in the Dockerfile.  Each of the images with "none" in the name are the intermediate steps specified in the Dockerfile.  The "docusaurus-tutorial_docusaurus" Docker image is the final result from the Dockerfile.

## Viewing the Tutorial App
* Enter the command `docker-compose up` to start the Docusaurus server.  In a few seconds, the Docusaurus app will be up and running locally.
* Open your web browser, and go to the URL http://localhost:3000/ on your host system.  Once again, your new Docusaurus app should appear.
* Open your web browser and go to the URL http://localhost:35729/ on your host sytem.  Once again, you're looking at the output of the LiveReload server, and you'll see something similar to this:
```
{"tinylr":"Welcome","version":"1.1.1"}
```
* Start a new terminal tab for running commands in the host environment.  (Remember, the original terminal tab is dedicated to running the Docusaurus app server and LiveReload server.)
* Enter the command `docker ps -a`.  The result should look something like this:
```
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                            COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS                                              NAMES

```
* Note that you now have a Docker container based on the docusaurus-tutorial_docusaurus Docker image.  This is running the Tutorial app.

## Cleaning Up
* In the Docker container, press "Ctrl-C" to stop the Docusaurus server.
* Remove the Docusaurus Tutorial app by entering the following commands:
```
cd
cd docker-docu
sudo rm -r docusaurus-tutorial
```
* Note that you had to delete your tutorial app with the "sudo" command because it was owned by root instead of your regular username.
* To delete all Docker networks, enter the command `docker network prune -f`..
* To delete all of the Docker containers, enter the following commands:
```
for i in $(docker ps -a -q)
do
  docker kill $i; wait;
  docker rm -f $i; wait;
done;
```
* To view the list of Docker containers, enter the command `docker ps -a`.  This list should now be empty.
* To view the list of Docker images, enter the command `docker images -a`.
* To delete all of these Docker images, enter the following commands:
```
for i in $(docker images -a -q)
do
  docker kill $i; wait;
  docker rmi -f $i; wait;
done;
```
* To view the list of Docker images, enter the command `docker images -a`.  This list should now be empty.
