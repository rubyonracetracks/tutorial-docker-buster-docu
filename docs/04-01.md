In this chapter, you will learn the general procedures for building Docker images.  Later chapters will focus on the processes of building specific Docker images.

* Repository of Common Docker Actions

## FAQ
Basic questions about the Ruby on Racetracks Docker build procedures are in the [FAQ](https://gitlab.com/rubyonracetracks/docker-debian-common/blob/master/FAQ.md).  Topics addressed include how to build Docker images on your local machine, how GitLab CI tools are used to generate and push Docker images, why GitLab's Docker repository is better than Docker Cloud, and why GitLab CI is better than Docker Cloud's automated build feature.

## Repository of Common Docker Actions
The repository of [common Docker actions](https://gitlab.com/rubyonracetracks/docker-debian-common/) contains scripts for various routine tasks pertaining to Docker images and containers.  It's an example of the DRY principle - Don't repeat yourself.  It's so much easier to make one change here than to make one change in each of multiple repositories.
