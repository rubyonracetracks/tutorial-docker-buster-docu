title: Unit 2 Introduction
---

In this unit, you will use the same Minimal Stage 2 Docker image with different Docker containers for JavaScript frameworks.  Note that the Minimal Stage 2 Docker image comes with NVM, Node.js, NPM, and yarn pre-installed.  This allows you to get started with new and legacy JavaScript projects.
